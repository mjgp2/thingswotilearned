# Things Wot I Learned

It's strange really, I always wanted to write a book, and here I am doing it. It's a book borne of an _almost_ morbid pretence: should I be struck down and squashed like a hedgehog by the 388 bus tomorrow, what would I have wished to have told my children. I mean, there must be something of value right? Well, you'd hope so, over the course of 35 years. That's the hypothesis at least.
